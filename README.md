# Polynomial Regression

In the real world, it is very common to have data where there is a non-linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. In these cases, we can use polynomial regression where we assume the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable(s) y is modelled as an nth degree polynomial in x.
